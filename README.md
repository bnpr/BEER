# Blender Extended Expressive Renderer

Blender Extended Expressive Renderer (BEER) is a free and open source realtime non-photoreal (NPR) rendering engine with Malt as the backend. The main feature of BEER is the ability to extend the rendering capability from the ease of adding custom shaders to a customizable shader graph.

BEER will have a layer stack UI (like in raster painting software). There will be a list of shaders povided by Malt's shader library. 

There will be 3 interfaces to create and to assemble shaders for BEER:
1. GLSL Code via Malt
2. Malt nodes (Code like node tree)
3. Layer stack (BEER UI)

Advanced users can create custom rendering pipelines optimize for their production.

Development update will be posted at: https://blendernpr.org/beer/
