# Blender Extended Expressive Renderer

Blender Extended Expressive Renderer (BEER) is a free and open source realtime non-photoreal (NPR) rendering engine. The main feature of BEER is the ability to extend the rendering capability from the ease of adding custom shaders to a customizable shader graph. Since NPR is a journey of endless styles which never settle, we need a render engine which will fulfill all the stylized needs.
